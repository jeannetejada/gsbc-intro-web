## Inspiration

My Youth Pastor introduced me to design when I was a sophomore in highschool. Since then, I fell in love with designing graphics and themes for church. The site that I often visit when I need help for inspiration is Igniter Media https://www.ignitermedia.com/title-graphics. This site really helped me when I struggle looking for church graphics.
