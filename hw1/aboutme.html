<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Welcome to my About Me page!

<p>Jeanne (Jay-anne) Tejada (Te-ha-da) was born and raised in the Philippines. She didn't get saved until she came to the United States with her family in 2016. Little did she know that God would allow her to go to Golden State Baptist College. Now, she is a Junior studying a General Major with a Media minor.

<p>There should be more here, but I don't know
what yet.
