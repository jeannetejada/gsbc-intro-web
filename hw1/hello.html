<h1>Jeanne's Website</h1>

<p>Welcome to my page!

<p>Jeanne (Jay-anne) Tejada (Te-ha-da) was born and raised in the Philippines. She didn't get saved until she came to the United States with her family in 2016. Little did she know that God would allow her to go to Golden State Baptist College. Now, she is a Junior studying a General Major with a Media minor.

<p>My Youth Pastor introduced me to design when I was a sophomore in highschool. Since then, I fell in love with designing graphics and themes for church. The site that I often visit when I need help for inspiration is Igniter Media https://www.ignitermedia.com/title-graphics. This site really helped me when I struggle to look for church graphics.
